## SpinCameraControls

`SpinCameraControls` is a [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) camera controller. 

This allows the camera to rotate around its own local axes, simulating a spinning or first-person-like rotation.

Unlike `OrbitControls`, which orbits the camera around a target point, `SpinCameraControls` lets you control the camera's own orientation directly.
